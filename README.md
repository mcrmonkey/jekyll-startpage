# Start-page generator

Experiment with Jekyll to create a 'start page' to replace your newtab page.

This uses elements from these projects:

 * https://github.com/navigatron/MyStartPage
 * https://github.com/seanvree/homepage

## Configuration

edit `_config.yml` with your desired setup


## Building Yourself

Install Jekyll, run this:

   bundle exec jekyll build

The resulting page will be placed in to `_site`

## Backgrounds

There are three backgrounds on offer:

 * static-color
 * random-remote
 * day-night

The static background color can be set in `_config.yml`

## Widgets

These are whats loaded in to the page. More than one can be loaded at once if
needed

There are only 2 right now:

 * navigatron
 * search-ddg
